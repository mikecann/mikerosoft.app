"""Generates 3x3 sheets of Mikerosoft 95 tool icons with Gemini via OpenRouter.

Each sheet draws 9 of SUBJECTS against the famfamfam-style reference in
style-ref.png, on flat magenta so slice.py can cut them out. Drawing 9 at once
keeps the family consistent. For a new tool, add it to SUBJECTS and draw just
its sheet. Needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the environment or the repo root .env. Sheets are ignored
by git; only the cut-out icons in public/icons are kept.

usage: python3 generate.py <sheet-index...>

PROMPT = """Make a 3x3 grid of 9 separate desktop application icons for a Windows 98 styled website.

Style: match the attached reference exactly in spirit. It shows famfamfam "silk" icons, which I want redrawn at high resolution: simple chunky shapes, a crisp dark outline around every object, bright friendly saturated colours, soft top-left lighting with gentle gradients, slight 3/4 perspective where it helps, no text except where asked, no drop shadow onto the background. Smooth, clean, high resolution vector-style illustration, NOT pixel art and NOT blocky. Each icon must read clearly when shrunk to 32 pixels, so keep details few and bold. All 9 icons must look like one consistent family.

Layout: exactly 3 columns and 3 rows, each icon centred in its own cell with plenty of empty space around it, nothing touching or overlapping between cells. Background: one flat solid pure magenta (#FF00FF) everywhere, with no gradients, borders, grid lines, labels or shadows. Never use magenta or pink inside the icons.

Icons, left to right, top to bottom:
